## idea

```md

- you're a tree. robots have taken over the planet. you're last one alive. you need to drink water to stay hydraded. 
you drop fruits then it started to grow. once you plant it enemies will come to hunt it. you need to protect it from robots.


- you're last soldier alive. you need to protect the king.

- you're only police alive. you need to run away from jail to inform the breakout.
